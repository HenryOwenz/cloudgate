## Installation

### Quick Install / Upgrade

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenryOwenz/cloudgate/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenryOwenz/cloudgate/main/scripts/install.ps1'))
```

These scripts will automatically download and install the latest version of cloudgate, handling upgrades cleanly if you already have it installed.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HenryOwenz/cloudgate.git
cd cloudgate
make build
make install  # Installs as 'cg' in your $GOPATH/bin
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.22+
- AWS credentials configured in `~/.aws/credentials` or `~/.aws/config`

## Usage

```bash
cg  # Launch the application
```

### Navigation

| Key       | Action                   |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| â†‘/â†“ or k/j | Navigate options         |
| Enter     | Select/Confirm           |
| Esc/-     | Go back/Cancel           |
| q         | Quit application         |
| Ctrl+c    | Force quit               |
| g/G       | Jump to top/bottom       |
| u/d       | Half page up/down        |
| b/f       | Page up/down             |

**Note:** Vim-style navigation keys (g, G, u, d, etc.) work in table views but are passed through as text when in input mode. Use Esc to exit text input mode.

## Development

### Testing

```bash
make test          # Run all tests
make test-unit     # Run unit tests only
make test-integration  # Run integration tests only
make test-coverage  # Generate coverage report
```

### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
- Automated builds on each push and pull request
- Unit and integration tests
- Code linting with golangci-lint
- Test coverage reporting
- Automatic testing of Dependabot PRs

## Architecture

cloudgate uses a dual-layer architecture:
- Provider layer: Abstracts cloud provider APIs
- UI layer: Handles user interaction and workflow

The application follows a modular design pattern that makes it easy to add new cloud services and operations. Each service is implemented as a separate module with clear interfaces, allowing for independent development and testing.

### Dependency Management

The project uses two complementary approaches to dependency management:

#### 1. Manual Updates via Make Targets

For direct control over dependency updates:

Update to latest patch versions and verify build:
```bash
make update-deps
```

Update to latest patch versions only:
```bash
make update-deps-patch
```

Update to latest minor versions:
```bash
make update-deps-minor
```

Update specific package to latest major version:
```bash
make update-deps-major PKG=github.com/example/package
```

#### 2. Automated Updates via Dependabot

The project uses GitHub Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates:

- Weekly checks for Go module updates
- Monthly checks for GitHub Actions updates
- Automatic testing of dependency updates
- Grouped updates to reduce PR noise
- Safety limits on open PRs to prevent overwhelming the repository

Dependabot configuration can be found in [.github/dependabot.yml](https://github.com/HenryOwenz/cloudgate/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml).
